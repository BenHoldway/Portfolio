                <div class="headerLine"></div>

                <p>Hi, I'm Ben Holdway, a current English Games Design and Programming student at the University of Staffordshire wanting to specialise in Gameplay Programming.</p>
                <p>
                    I've been programming for nearly a decade now, working with languages from HTML to Python to C++ and C#. I've been a part of many different projects
                    inside and out of games, both solo and in groups. Not all projects are shown, as they are not relevant, however a list of my experiences is listed below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a kid, growing up playing games like Minecraft and the Halo franchise, I was always questioning how these different mechanics and features were created. I spent hours
                    trying to solve problems as I played, and wondered how they created such things. While I was beginning my GCSEs, something clicked and I realised that I could work on
                    projects like this myself, without a big company team behind me. This is where I started my story towards games programming.
                </p>
