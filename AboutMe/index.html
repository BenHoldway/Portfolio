                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <div class="headerLine"></div>

                <p>Hi, I'm Ben Holdway, a current English Games Design and Programming student at the University of Staffordshire wanting to specialise in Gameplay Programming.</p>
                <p>
                    I've been programming for nearly a decade now, working with languages from HTML to Python to C++ and C#. I've been a part of many different projects
                    inside and out of games, both solo and in groups. Not all projects are shown, as they are not relevant, however a list of my experiences is listed below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a kid, growing up playing games like Minecraft and the Halo franchise, I was always questioning how these different mechanics and features were created. I spent hours
                    trying to solve problems as I played, and wondered how they created such things. While I was beginning my GCSEs, something clicked and I realised that I could work on
                    projects like this myself, without a big company team behind me. This is where I started my story towards games programming.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container lighterBox">
                <h1>Interests in Games</h1>

                <div class="headerLine"></div>
                
                <p>Outside of working on the development of games, I spend a lot of my free time watching and playing games. The games content
                    that I consume is of a wide range, from sandbox games like Minecraft and Sea of Thieves, rogue-likes like Risk Of Rain.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The genre that I enjoy the most is horror - from the typical scare-factor horror to the more psychological horror side which messes 
                    with their players - including indie titles like Phasmophobia and REPO, as well as larger titles like the Resident Evil franchise and 
                    Subnautica.</p>
                <p></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sectionBox">
            <div class="container lighterBox">
                <h1>Outside Interests</h1>

                <div class="headerLine"></div>

                <h2>TTRPGs</h2>
                <p>My current main fixation, for multiple years now, are TTRPGs like Dungeons and Dragons, and Pathfinder. These games allow me 
                    to design cool characters and express myself through playing them. My experiences with these games has helped me develop as a
                    person, working and communicating with others I do not know well.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have made countless different characters, all with lengthy backstories and interesting personalities.</li>
                    <li>I've Indulge myself in a large range of character types to keep sessions interesting for myself.</li>
                    <li>As well as playing, I have ran my own sessions for both experienced and newer players.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                
                <h2>Art</h2>
                <p>Touching on my creative side, I have drawn art on and off my entire life, but more consistently over the last 3 years. I used to
                    draw on paper when I was younger, but moved to digital art when I got access to programs.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 years ago, I started art again with making fanart of others' designs and characters.</li>
                    <li>Built up my skill through commitment and studies, striving to produce pieces which I am proud of.</li>
                    <li>Have since been able to produce designs of my own characters, both for TTRPG characters and other personal designs.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <h2>Twitch Moderating</h2>
                <p>With watching gaming content, I use services like Youtube and Twitch a lot. From being in numerous Twitch communities and being 
                    known in them, I've had the opportunity to moderate for some for multiple years now.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I spend time watching chat to make sure everyone follows the rules and nothing wrong is said.</li>
                    <li>If anyone breaks any rules within the community, I am one to take initiative and deal with the issue, whether that is to communicate to the person or take action against them.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
